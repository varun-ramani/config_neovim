# Varun's Neovim Configuration

## Installation
Clone into $HOME/.config/nvim/

## Setup
Install the `neovim` package with pip
Start neovim and run `:PlugUpdate`, which will download and install my plugins.
Then, run `:UpdateRemotePlugins` which will get deoplete working. 
Finally, set your terminal font to a font that supports powerline - any of the Nerd Fonts should do.
